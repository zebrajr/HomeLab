# Bash System Bootstraper

Bash based "ansible-look-a-like"

An attempt at bootstrapping a Linux System - initially just Fedora Minimal - to a Full Running OS with bash.

The `Win Goal` is to be the same - or better - then installing Fedora KDE Plasma and then using the Ansible Playbook to get the host 99% ready to use.

## Before First Run

## Configuring and What's What

## Running

- Configure `settings.json`

- Run `sudo ./bootstrap.sh`

## ToDo
- [ ] Add "LACT" (Linux GPU Configuration and Monitoring Tool) to Battlestation
- [ ] Move everything to dedicate scripts
